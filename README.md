# boilerplate Tachyons with react and webpack

Basic set up to for easy customisation for tachyons with webpack.

The idea here is to build tachyons from source. This allows us to:
  1. Overwrite colors and media queries
  2. Use variables from tachyons in our own custom css
  3. Keep the tachyons source out of git history.


## How could this be better?

We should build a module that uses tachyons-css to configure postcss
